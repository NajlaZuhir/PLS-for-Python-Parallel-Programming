This app helps you learn parallel and distributed computing in Python through interactive quizzes, a smart chatbot, and a code mentor.
You can generate quizzes from PDFs, YouTube videos, or web links, chat with an AI tutor, and get help debugging or converting your code across different parallel paradigms.
All features are integrated into a Streamlit interface, powered by OpenAI, Mistral, and Docker.
To activate, create a .env file with your OpenAI and Mistral API keys, and make sure Docker is installed and running.
